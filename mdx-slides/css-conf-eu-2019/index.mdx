# What are "tags" in HTML?

# A short trip through the history of HTML

---

# [_Hypertext Markup Language - 2.0_](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1866)

- Document standardizing HTML, though had been in use since ~1990
- Published by Tim Berners-Lee in November 1995
- States: "HTML documents are SGML documents with generic semantics that are
   appropriate for representing information from a wide range of
   domains."

---

# SGML? SGML!

- A general document markup langauge standardized in 1986
- Two types of entites:
    - Type-valid, essentially "doctypes" for each document
    - Tag-valid, where every piece of information has a surrounding XML "tag"

---

# GML

- Predecessor to SGML
- Like SGML, created by Charles F. Goldfarb at IBM
- [In 1969 he was already using the word "tags"](http://www.sgmlsource.com/history/roots.htm), as in:
> "using an un-filled-in outline of tags as a prompter from which to create a new document"
- "tags" === "container for data"

---

# Tracing "tags" so far:

# GML (1969) ➡️   SGML (1986) ➡️  HTML (1995)

---

# So, where did "tag" in 1969 come from?

---

# Introducing, etymology!

---

# Etymology

> "the study of the origin of words and the way in which their meanings have changed throughout history."

---

# e.g. "cascade"

<img src="assets/cascade-etymology.png" style={{height: "40vh"}} alt="tree showing how the word cascade comes from Latin, to Italian meaning 'to fall'" />

---

# What's the earliest use of "tag" in computing?

---

# Emil Leon Post

<img src="assets/Emil_Leon_Post.jpg" style={{height: "70vh"}} alt="Portrait of Emil Leon Post" />


---

# First instance of "tag"

- _Formal Reductions of the General Combinatorial Decision Problem_ (**1943**)
- Post introduces a "tag system", a computational model for producing words from production rules

---

# Example:

<img style={{height: '80vh'}} src="./assets/tag-system-example.png" />


---

# Why "tags"?

- Footnote on page 12 suggests it comes from the children's game of "tag"!

    <img src="assets/tag-footnote.png" style={{height: "30vh"}} alt="Screenshot of footnote reading: In an earilier formulation of this problem we merely checked off each successive μ-th letter of the sequence starting with b1, at the same time adding the corresponding associated sequences to the right end of the sequence. Whether the iterative process terminated or not then depended on whether the constantly advancing check mark did or did not overtake the monotonically advancing right end of the sequence, whence the suggest name of 'tag' given the problem by B.P. Gill." />

- "Tag" here refers axioms "chasing" each other in order to produce the next word

---

## The etymology chain of "tag"

# tag, children's game (1600's) ➡️
# Emil Post/B.P. Gill (1943) ➡️
# GML (1969) ➡️ 
# SGML (1986) ➡️ 
# HTML (1995)
