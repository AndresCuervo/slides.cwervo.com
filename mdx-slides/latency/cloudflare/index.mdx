# Latency, Real-Time Software, & Cloudflare

Note to self: see in Notion @Why build custom hardware for spatial computing? Because computers are not spatial!

I'm interested in the question of latency, not for its own sake but for what _experiences_ we might build

# A simple example

Google developed the TPU to make the experience of developing machine learning

# Something old, something new

Basically talk about how this is an old problem of knowledge reproduction, copying information [a book, an image, a bank balance, a database value](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/an-in-depth-look-at-googles-first-tensor-processing-unit-tpu)

### Computers we not made for realtime control, they were made for war (Difference Engine, ENIAC, Bletchly Park) & for business (IBM). We've spent the last few decades talking about personal computers, but that's the wrong model. Computers are a tool & [a tool is:](http://worrydream.com/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign/) "A tool addresses human needs by amplifying human capabilities."

So, what do we make of this business? Of prying apart clients/servers?

# Latency as a function of human control

(humans are not computers: we don't have infinite state & such)
