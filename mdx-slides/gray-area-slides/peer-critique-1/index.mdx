# _Lace_
## Andr&eacute;s Cuervo

# Concept

**_Lace_** is a piece that uses _projection mapping_ and _a custom gestural langauge_ to ~~express~~ imagine _a world where interacting with technology feels like play._

How is it experienced?

- Small scale: iPad → tablet → desktop → projector + whiteboard table
- Large scale: room/building lined with short-throw projectors & whiteboard painted walls

# What are your desired outcomes?


I want the viewer/participant to feel/experience:

- a series of small interactions with technology.
- as a guiding light, e.g.:
    - drawing communally, with the computer as a fellow "participant"
    - playing with information like a toy
    - building with physical/digital tools seamlessly

---

# Technology

- Javascript
- Gesture recognition/CV:
    - [TensorFlow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/) (?)
    - [GRAIL method](https://jackschaedler.github.io/handwriting-recognition/) (?)
- Projector
- Webcam

---

# What are your resource needs?

- Projector
- Webcam
- Whiteboard
- Table

# Timeline

- **September 5**: Initial system built, running on a real projector, can interpret text & use that to control a simple turtle
- **October 3**: 2 "toys"/experiences built (turtle + 1 more, whatever prototype seems more achievable initially)
- **November 7**: Third "toy" prototyped & built
- **December 1**: All experiences polished, have a mechanism for easily switching between toys & easily manage relationship b/w whiteboard/drawing & projector virtual state

---

# What would success look like?

An installation of _Lace_ that runs continously, smoothly, and that participants can just walk up to. Ideally mobile, installable in a room.

---

# Challenges

- computation scope
- how to manage interaction b/w drawing & projection

<!--
- I don't want to build an entire operating system (yet), need to define my scope, with "toys" in mind, more narrowly so I don't spin my wheels
- How to manage state between drawing surface & projection (e.g. what happens when I draw a turtle & then virtual turtle moves? Ask to erase? Mark in red?)
-->

# Question to the group

- Too ambitious?
- Define experience first, or technical limits?

# Thanks!
