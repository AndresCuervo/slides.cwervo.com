# Concept

**_Lace_** is a piece that uses _projection mapping_ and _a custom gestural langauge_ to ~~express~~ imagine _a world where interacting with technology feels like play._

How is it experienced?

- Small scale: iPad → tablet → desktop → projector + whiteboard table
- Large scale: room/building lined with short-throw projectors & whiteboard painted walls
