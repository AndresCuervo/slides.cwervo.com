-----

1. Go through my personal inspirations and considerations of interactive storytelling.
2. Show a sphere being wrapped with a grid, and a 360 2d equirectangular image --> same image in A-Frame
3. Why trees? Talk about abstract meaning, interaction model,
4. Conclude?

(2017-04-26) Isaac notes:

1. [x] Reorder
- books are personal inspiration, text based games are weird because it's not personal to me
    - narrative (books) --> graphics is a weird transition, so talk about my inspiration _and then_ graphics/polygons/video games
    - popup books --> choose your own adventure --> Pokemon / another 3D video games
        - Then have a transition to history of video games, text-based narratives, graphics go up, etc.
    - [x] This image is wild, switch to be:
        - picture -> sphere GIF -> image

2. [x] Earth instead of Jasper (already have the image somewhere! Although maybe you should probably get a single-color one)
- Do earth equirectangular image instead of Jasper!!!!! :D Would make so much more sense!

3. [x] Make the building of it more apparent, real behind-the-scenes feel :)
- Talk more about the concept nature in VR, rehearse that more?
    - Maybe put little panic button demo in this section
    - Talk about the sun more, it's points
        - Make them absolute, and fragment, so they overlap!
        - one, two, then:

        - https://media.giphy.com/media/l0IygYxAsj2JNHfI4/giphy.gif

    - Talk more about how you did it, pictures, globe, adding color, adding sun, trees

For Isaac:
shorten/break up the begnning, to make it more memorable
environmentally & emotionally functional?
what's the specific use of environment in the 1960's art group? you say it's specific, but you don't specify

switch with Sam or Alex in my section
