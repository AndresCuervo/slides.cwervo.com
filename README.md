# slides.cwervo.com

This is a little collection of my slides using [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js)

Download all the dependencies by running:
```
npm install
```

All you should need is a local server.

The main page, though, is generated using [showdown](https://github.com/AndresCuervo/slides.cwervo.com) from `a talks.json`, and is compiled using this command:

```bash
npm fp # stands for "front page"
```
